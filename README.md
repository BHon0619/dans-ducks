# Dan's Ducks
Some other Dan really loves ducks. Dan loves ducks so much, he wants to build a simple website about the different types of ducks that exist in the world. Unfortunately, Dan is new to web development and will need your help building his site.

**Note**: We may get a very basic site made by the end or we may not. I'm just winging it at the moment.

### Week 9/15 - 9/21
Dan has created a folder called "images" in his root directory. Unfortunately, he does not have time to collect images of majestic mallards. He has posted tasks on which ducks to add to the folder and where you can find an image of them. These tasks can be found on the Issues tab on his GitHub repository.

If there are no issues available, slack me and I'll create one for you.
